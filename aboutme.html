<h2>About Travis</h2>
<p> My name is Travis, and I’m a student at El Camino High School with a growing interest in graphic and web design. I first got interested in design by hearing about my step-mom, who is a graphic designer seeing all her work on projects at home really were impressive to see. When I talked to my counselor about exploring something new and useful, I chose this class because it seemed like the perfect way to learn some new skills in Graphic Design. I figured it was a great chance to try something different and exit my comfort zone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How Inspiration Works (And How To Find It) - Work It daily this year in class, I’ve learned a lot of new skills that have introduced me into the Digital Design World. I’ve gotten experience with Photoshop, where I learned how to edit images, use layers, and create eye-catching designs. I also learned how to make websites using WordPress, which showed me how to make pages well structured and proffesional. One of the most joyful projects was creating logos, where I got to experiment with shapes, fonts, and color combinations. Overall, this class has given me a solid foundation in graphic, and I feel much more confident using these tools after taking this class. Im now being introduced to the Web Design class and hope to learn something new.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the future, I want to use the design skills I learned to start creating designs for my own T-shirt company I want to start. I think it would be exciting to build a brand and see people wear something I made. While I plan to keep digital design as a hobby, it’s also a great way to make some extra money while doing something I enjoy. My long-term goal is to become a pilot, but I believe me having design skills will always be useful, for personal projects or even making my own business. This class has helped me take the first steps toward making those ideas real.&nbsp;</p>
